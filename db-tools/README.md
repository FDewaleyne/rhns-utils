**package-consistency-checker.py**
This script adds to a channel packages based on criteria - it is meant to help remove packages that should not have been synced. It is meant to be used along with `spacewalk-remove-channel --force -c CHANELLABEL` ; to keep the packages on your `/var/satellite` add `--justdb`
